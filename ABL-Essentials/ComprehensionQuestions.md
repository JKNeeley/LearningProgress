## Developing Program Logic
Which data types can you use to define variables?
- character, integer, decimal, date, datetime, rowid, handle

Which function would you use to convert numerical data to character?

When does the INTEGER function round up or down a decimal value?
- Rounds up if the decimal value is greater than or equal to 0.5 and rounds down if the decimal value is less than 0.5.

## Using Queries
What does the OPEN QUERY statement do?

How do you retrieve records from a results list?

Rewrite the following ABL statement using a shorter syntax:.
```
OPEN QUERY qQuery FOR EACH Order WHERE Order.OrderNum = Orderline.OrderNum
```
- OPEN QUERY qQuery FOR EACH Order OF Orderline

How can a query results list be accessed randomly?
- Define a query with the SCROLLING option, and then use REPOSITION and GET.

Which of the following is true about ROWID?
